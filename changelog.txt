---
v.1.0 - 20/06/2018 (First public release)
 * No special dependencies, besides PIL/Pillow (this enables full compatibility
   with iPhones and iPads running Pythonista 3)
 * Basic CLI argument parsing, with separate groups of arguments for JPEG and
   PNG images.
 * Multiprocessing support on multicore and multiprocessor computers for really
   fast operation.
 * Multithreading support on Pythonista/iOS, for slightly improved performance
   (too bad, multiprocessing is currently not supported on that environment).
 * Supports optimization of both folders and individual files.
 * Option to avoid recursion into subdirectories (by default, it will recurse).
 * Option for manually setting JPEG quality (by default, 70%).
 * Option for reducing the number of colors by applying adaptive palette to PNG
